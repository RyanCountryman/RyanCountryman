<h3>Capstone: NES Emulation</h3>
  For our senior capstone project, our 4-person team was tasked with designing and developing a functional emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). This is an ongoing project that combines   
  deep technical research with practical software engineering, following the Agile methodology with regular sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives.

In the early phases, we conducted extensive research into the NES architecture, focusing on the 6502-based CPU, memory mapping, and the system's graphical and audio subsystems -- the PPU (Picture Processing Unit) and APU (Audio Processing Unit). Our team reviewed official documentation, community-written hardware wikis, and existing ROM test suites to build a strong foundation for development.

As of now, we have achieved:

- Full implementation of all NES CPU instructions, including addressing modes

- Debugging tools to verify CPU behavior using standard test ROMs

- Pattern Table image dump visualization from the CHR-ROM, enabling early graphics verification

Future sprints will focus on completing the PPU and APU systems, integrating memory mirroring and sprite rendering, with the goal of supporting homebrew and public domain NES titles with visual and audio output.
